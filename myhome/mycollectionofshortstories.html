	<h2> skinless grapes </h2>
	<br></br>
	<div class="short-story-one">
		<p>When I was five, my mother would peel the skin of grapes off for me. I hated the feeling of the skin in my mouth so much that I made my mother peel the skin of grapes off for me. I remember the pile of the slimy skin on a napkin and the small pile of the skinless grapes, which never really gathered any grapes because as my mother peeled them I would eat them. She wouldn’t mind peeling the grapes for me, sometimes she would even have them ready for me after school</p>
	    <p>At twenty, my mother at the ripe age of fifty would continue to peel grapes for me. I would come home late at night to find a yellow bowl full of the skinless grapes. It was sticky around the edges. Sometimes I would join her on the counter closest to the window to peel them, but I didn’t last that long before my frustration got in the way. The feeling of getting the skin stuck between my nails and in between my fingers made me stop. She would start to me tell me about the mice men who dance in her dreams and would run off when she tried to push them away with her broom. </p>
	    <p>When I was thirty, my mother was seventy one now and she peeled grapes for me. She lived slower, much slower than I remembered her to be. I would visit my mom during the summers now and she had gotten the hobby of knitting mittens. When she had started, I remember having three pairs waiting for me the first summer I came back home and a yellow bowl full of skinless grapes. They were a little wet and sticky, probably from the grape juice left behind from her peeling them. She peeled the grapes much more slowly and missed some skin bits on the grapes now. The skin didn’t bother me as much anymore, even if I told her that she didn’t have to do it anymore, peeling grapes had become part of her routine when I came around.</p>
	    <p>The following summer my mother peeled a bowl of grapes for me. We were sitting on the counter closest to the window this summer and she had told me about her dream with the mice men who dance. She always told me that they had come to visit her again and usually she would shoo the mice men away in her dreams, but this time she had danced with them. We continued to peel grapes as I imagined her dancing with mice men. </p>
	    <p>Now I was seventy one, and I can’t seem to remember my mothers face at all. I remember the warmth and care she brought with her. I miss the yellow bowl full of skinless grapes that my mother would have ready for me and even the mittens she knitted for me when I was thirty. She would have been sitting near the window hovered over the yellow bowl dropping in the skinless grapes in for me. Sometimes I still see silhouette at night near the window with the yellow bowl and I want to believe that she”ll come home again. </p>

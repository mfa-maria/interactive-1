		<h2>history</h2>
		  <p>Tomatillos were domesticated in Mexico before the coming of Europeans and played an important part in the culture of the Maya and the Aztecs, more important than the tomato. The specific name philadelphica dates to the 18th century.</p>
		<h3>production</h3>
		  <p>There is limited information about tomatillo production, even though tomatillos are distributed and grown worldwide as a home-grown garden plant. Tomatillos are mainly cultivated in outdoor fields in Mexico and Guatemala on a large scale. Smaller crops are planted in many parts of the United States. In Mexico, tomatillos are planted within a wide range of altitudes.</p>

		<h4>soil & climate requirments</h4>
		  <p>In general, tomatillo plants are tolerant to many different soil conditions. However, they do best in well-drained, sandy, fertile soil conditions with a pH between 5.5 and 7.3.[14] Tomatillo plants are cold sensitive.[15] They grow best at 25 to 32 °C (77 to 90 °F). Below 16 °C (61 °F), growth is very poor.[13] Tomatillo plants prefer full sun exposure and warm locations.</p>
		<h5>seedbed requirement & sowing</h5>
		  <p>Transplanting is the most common practice for planting tomatillo plants. Transplants are produced in greenhouses or transplant beds. Germination occurs at 20 to 27 °C (68 to 81 °F). Transplanting occurs 6 to 8 weeks after seeding and when the risk of frost is past. Transplants produced indoors need to harden off in a warm, sunny place for a few days before being planted outside. Direct outdoor seeding can only be done if no frost risk exists and soil temperature is higher than 15 °C (59 °F). Direct outdoor seeding leads to the shortening of the vegetation period. Due to its branching growing pattern, a single plant requires sufficient growing space. Tomatillos are typically grown in rows 0.7 to 1.6 m (2.3 to 5.2 ft) apart. Although tomatillo is a perennial plant, overwintering is difficult, so it is normally cultivated as an annual plant.</p>
		<h6>fertilization & field management</h6>
		  <p>Tomatillo plants can reach heights of 1.5 to 2 meters (4.9 to 6.6 ft). Due to their rapid and branching growth, it is recommended to stake them. Staking also facilitates later harvesting and prevents the fruit from touching the ground, which reduces damage to fruit and husk. Staking can also reduce disease and slug damage. Fertilization is recommended at a moderate level. An application of 40–90 kg/ha (36–80 lb/acre) of phosphorus is common. Other nutrients and fertilizers (N/ K) may be required depending on soil type and irrigation. For non-commercial production, regular fertilization is recommended. Although tomatillo plants become more drought-tolerant as they age, regular watering is required. Tomatillo plants require 25–38 mm (1.0–1.5 in) of water per week. Water can come from rainfall or irrigation. Irrigation can be managed by drip, sprinkler, furrow, or watering can. Irrigation frequency depends on weather and the crop's growth stage, ranging from once or twice a week to daily during hot weather. Weeds are a serious challenge in tomatillo production and are especially important during the first few weeks. Plastic and organic mulches help to control weeds effectively. Applications of plastic mulches also help to restrict soil water evaporation and modify microclimate, thereby affecting tomatillo growth and yield.</p>
		<h7>harvest & postharvest treatment</h7>
		  <p>Tomatillos are harvested when the fruits fill the calyx. This state is normally achieved 65 to 100 days after transplanting. Fruit production continues for 1 to 2 months or until the first frost. Harvesting occurs regularly, typically every day, and is done by hand. A plant produces 60 to 200 fruits within a single growing season, with an average yield of about 9 short tons per acre (20 t/ha). Tomatillos can be stored for up to three weeks in a cold and humid environment.</p>

		<p>The tomatillo (from Nahuatl, tomatl) is also known as husk tomato, Mexican groundcherry, large-flowered tomatillo, or Mexican husk tomato.Some of these names, however, can also refer to other species in the genus Physalis.Other names are Mexican green tomato and miltomate.</p>
		<p>In Spanish, it is called tomate de cáscara (husk tomato),tomate de fresadilla (little strawberry tomato), tomate milpero (field tomato), tomate verde (green tomato), tomatillo (Mexico; this term means "little tomato"elsewhere), miltomate (Mexico,Guatemala), farolito (little lantern), or simply tomate (in which case the tomato is called jitomate from Nahuatl xitomatl).</p>
		<p>The tomatillo genus name Physalis is from New Latin physalis, coined by Linnaeus from Ancient Greek φυσαλλίς (physallís, "bladder, wind instrument"), itself from φυσιόω (physióō, "to puff up, blow up"), φυσώ (physṓ).</p>
		<p>Ixocarpa means "slimey fruit", referencing a sticky or slimey coat often on a Tomatillo before it ruptures from the calyx.</p>
